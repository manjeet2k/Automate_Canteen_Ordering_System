# Automated Canteen Ordering System 


The purpose is to build the application for ordering food online by various companies' employees and collect it faster instead of standing in the queue in this busy office schedule. 


The concept is ordering food to an Office premises common canteen similar to any food court where all the companies employees belong to that building can order the food. Other than the employees belong to that office premises, people from outside can also order their food using the application.


Different types of users to access the application:


Admin: The one who will be the owner of the application or someone from the administration section of the office premises who will have the authority to the application. (For Example, Godrej Genesis)


Employees (Belong to the companies in this specific canteen premises) ‘OR’ Ordinary people from outside.


Canteen Chefs or the Food Stores (Madras Cafe - for South Indian food, China Bytes - for Chinese food, French Cafe - for Snacks and Beverages, etc.) presented in those premises.


Create an Admin user and share the admin access to them so that the admin users can create other users like:


Section to Create or Remove Companies belong to them


Section to Create or Remove Food Stores belong to them


Approve or Reject Employees access belong to the associated companies and non-associated companies as well.


Approve or Reject Chefs access belongs to the associated food stores.


Show and Hide Order Notification option.


Create Order Status like Received, Preparing/Cooking, Finished, Delivered.

Add Food Categories (Noth-Indian, Chinese, South-Indian, Continental, etc.)


Set priority for the users ordering process (Like associated company employees will be prioritized for the order approval and non-associated people will be less prior for the order approval.)


Other than admin, users will be able to create an account and login to the application via their Facebook or mail id (Google, Outlook, Yahoo, etc.)
